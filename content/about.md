I’m Hassan, a software developer who builds things that matter to me — small, focused tools and powerful command-line utilities that get the job done without unnecessary complexity. My work tends to live close to the metal: I care about performance, correctness, and really understanding what I’m building.

I started with languages like C# and Python, picked up fundamentals in C, dipped into JavaScript (which taught me a lot — even if it wasn’t love at first sight), and ultimately found a long-term home in Rust because of how it balances reliability with expressiveness. I also enjoy working with Nuxt for creating beautiful user interfaces and experiences.

My projects tend to avoid the hype. I’m not chasing AI buzzwords, Web3, or cloud-first philosophies. What gets me excited is software you can trust, code you can reason about, and tools that respect your time and attention.

Beyond code, I’m also documenting how I think and build — from deep dives into Rust to project walkthroughs — and sharing the process with others. That’s partly why I’ve started a YouTube series focused on calm, project-driven programming in different operating systems: it’s about the craft, not the bells and whistles.

When I’m not writing code, I’m learning something new, tinkering with systems, or planning the next project. I try to approach problems the same way I approach life: with curiosity, patience, and a willingness to explore until the right solution reveals itself.

If you like thoughtful software, clear explanations, and projects built with intention, you’ll probably feel at home here.
